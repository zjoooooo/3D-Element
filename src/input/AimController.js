/**
 * Targeting, in the two shapes players already know from MOBAs.
 *
 * A **line cast** arms an arrow that swings about the caster and fires along
 * its length; a **far cast** arms a circle that follows the cursor and drops
 * where it is clicked. Which one an ability uses is declared in
 * `ELEMENT_META[...].cast`, and the controller swaps indicators on selection —
 * everything else about arming, clamping, validating and firing is shared,
 * because from the targeting side the only difference is what gets drawn.
 *
 * The controller owns the aim state and both indicators; it decides nothing
 * about what the cast does. It emits one event, `cast`, with an origin, a unit
 * direction and a distance — which is exactly the signature the ability's
 * `spawn` takes. A far cast reads its target point off the far end of that
 * line, so the ability contract never had to change.
 *
 * The pointer is re-projected every frame rather than only on move, so orbiting
 * the camera with the cast armed swings the indicator under a stationary
 * cursor.
 *
 * Emits: `cast` (origin, direction, distance), `arm`, `cancel`, `reject`.
